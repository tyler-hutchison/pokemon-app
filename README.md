POKEMON APP

This application is similar to a Pokedex from the video game series Pokemon. Search pokemon by name or by index and it will show you that pokemon and 
some of its stats using freeCodeCamp's PokeAPI Proxy, found here: "https://pokeapi-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/". 

I wrote this app as part of the freeCodeCamp full stack developer curriculum.
